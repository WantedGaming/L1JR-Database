Is this the "Talking Island"?
I'm pretty sure that's what a Knight from the "House of Red Knight" would say.
There seems to be no doubt in the information that there are those who are plotting to raise the flag against His Majesty here.
But, Your Majesty, you are not too concerned, are you? Even though he is Duke Depill's son, what can he do by himself?...
Watch your language. Do you think that you, as a person like you, can have an opinion on a decision made by His Majesty himself?
And I went too far!
Well, let's go back to the castle for now. I must warn you, don't pull out your sword carelessly on anyone.
Yes, sir!
