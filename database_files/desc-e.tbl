Is this the "Talking Island"?
I'm pretty sure that's what a Knight from the "House of Red Knight" would say.
There seems to be no doubt in the information that there are those who are plotting to raise the flag against His Majesty here.
But, Your Majesty, you are not too concerned, are you? Even though he is Duke Depill's son, what can he do by himself?...
Watch your language. Do you think that you, as a person like you, can have an opinion on a decision made by His Majesty himself?
And I went too far!
Well, let's go back to the castle for now. I must warn you, don't pull out your sword carelessly on anyone.
Yes, sir!
In the meantime, it would be faster to try to make contact with the island's inhabitants and ransack those who look like them.
...Wouldn't it be better to go and visit Gunter first and ask him?
Do you think Gunter will cooperate with us when he is highly antagonistic to His Majesty?
...How about we just kill everyone who lives on this island, including Gunter? That way, we won't have to worry about it later...
Did I not tell you before to watch your mouth? Whoever spills the blood of an innocent man will be rewarded tenfold.
...The question, again, is whether the person we are looking for is actually making headway here...
...No, just the opposite. It is those who are showing their heads that are the dangerous ones, the ones who are against Your Majesty. Now, be vigilant and watch your surroundings!
Yes, sir!
Report on the search.
Yes, sir! So far, no one is particularly suspicious.
But...the people who live on this island seem to have a general antipathy toward His Majesty.
In fact, we were even almost attacked during the patrol.
We did not find anyone "particularly" suspicious, but on the contrary, all the people on the island are somehow "a little" suspicious.
I see. So we can't let down our guard against this island after all...
All right, that's it for today, we're going home. All clear out!
Yes, sir!
Where did these cheeky things come from...!
...Poor guys....you can't tell at a glance what they're capable of...
Gosh!
...Pfft, killing me is ...... useless.... Reports of traitors here have already reached His Majesty's ears ...... and soon another strike force will come...

The soul oppressed in the picture is filled with wrath and so...
Trying to appease the wrath of the oppressed soul...
Leaving the way of restraint and entering the path of freedom...
The door of oppression will open...
The division between faith and disbelief engulfs the heart and...
The separation between materiality and intangibility sharpens the jaws of death...
The eye of emotion is covered by the eye of reason...
I am the flame that doesn't go out -- and the one that blocks the wind.

Woof! Whew... You're clothes are gonna get dirty.
Woof, woof! I've got to go gracefully.
Woof, woof! I'll stay with you, master...
Whew... I'm tired.
Whew... What do you want?
Whew... Well, are you at least going to give me something to eat?
Whew... I like being with you the most, master.

Oh... The enemy has invaded! Defend Lastabad to the death!
Aaah... The passageway door has been penetrated! Stop the enemy!
Aayaah... The Evil Power Squad Leader's Room door has been opened but it would be better not to engage in any more reckless challenges.
Ugh... The passageway to the underground has been opened but it won't be safe.
It's true that I killed Dark Fencer but I'm no equal to the Evil Power King.
Get back. You will regret it the moment you go past here.
This is where the Evil Power Army King stays. Your fate ends here!
Hey... If you're so tough, you can go up against the Evil Spirit Army.
Sinclair will definitely deal with you... Aye.
Hee, hee.... Becomes prey of ferocious beasts
My Evil Power ones... Stop these invaders.
Dark Fencer... Show me the strength of the Evil Power Brigade.
Whew.... Are you saying that the Lastabad Evil Power Brigade has collapsed?
My Drake ones... Stop them so they can't attack... Stop them...
You will feel the power of the Evil Magic Troup Leader Carmiel.
The door of the magic laboratory has been opened. Block it before the invaders arrive.
The first door has been opened. Block it!
The second door has been opened. Block it!!
The third door has been opened. Block it!!
I knew the Evil Spirit King's hands would be dirtied...
How vexing... This is all the power that the Evil Spirit Army has?
Stop them! Protect the Lastabad Magic Guide!
Stop them! Protect the Lastabad Scroll!
Hee, hee....
The Evil Spirit Army has collapsed... How could that have happened?!
Wow!
It recognized my existence... How could...?
Whoa!
Whoa!
As long as Bright Magic Squad Leader is there, we won't be able to go any further!
I lost but Lastabad didn't lose.
This is a warning! Destruction will come if you proceed any further!
Block them so they can't go any farther!
This is my last warning! You will be destroyed if you enter here!
Already at a place from which one cannot retreat....
Hahaha. You fools... I, Hellvine, will be revived! Kneel before the new master of Lastabad!
Oh... Mercenary Commander Mephaisto will get revenge!
Ah... Long live Mephaisto!!
I believe in the power of Mephaisto.
.....
Whew.... I will wait for Mephaisto.
You have already lost.
Is this the defeat of Mephaisto? I can't believe it. I can't believe...
We are the loyal Assassin Squad.
Do you want to see the power of Assassin Squad Leader Blaze?
That's an underground prison. It would be better not to go there...
OK... You'll disappear into that deep underground dungeon.
Regardless of where you go, you'll never make it back alive.
Are you going to oppose Palace Guard Commander Kyte?
Get a taste of the trained, select assassins.
A challenge to Assassin Army King Slave means death.
I have met my end in this place....
Oh.... The top assassin of their group defeated me. He's got really surprising ability!
Ariok
Sniff, sniff... I smell a human... Where is it?
Whew.... Treasure... Just that treasure...
Kuman...! Get away....

It gets stronger as it dies.
You will be on your knees at the end of this road.
You're worthless... Do not speculate because the death of insignificant light means the birth of holy darkness...
Are you going to choose the way of the insignificant light? You will regret it.
You're not pure... You cannot deceive my eyes...
I will give you the will of purity...
Follow me, you weakling...
I will engrave the will of the person deep in your heart...
I will fill the body and soul with pure darkness...
Greet him with your head bowed down...
I have to overcome this with my will...
Thank you for ending my pain...
Argh... Don't control me!!
I'm finally going back...

Cerenis
Yes, that's how it is.
I'm quite impressive, aren't I?
Huh... Are you admitting it?
Yeah, because it's [Olim], it'll at least draw some attention.
This is so inspiring!
That's right.
I'll join you soon.
[Olim], I'll curse you!
What does that mean?
What! Show my strength?
I don't even think about situations like this!
Your role is [Olim]!
You've lived here for so long! I can't believe it!
You fool, [Olim]!
[Olim] has no choice!
What could this mean?
If you use [Cure: Poison], you can turn orcs white!
My mom's name is [Eva]... but what was my dad's name? Huh?
I have someone I love, hehe, but who they are is a secret.
I command you to come out! [Magic Bead!], hehe... it still doesn't work ^^;;
Waters of life! Winds of time! Make me [mature]... huh... well, that's it ^^;;
I don't like sweet things. But... the taste of bitter blood...
[Eva]'s daughter will never feel thirsty.
I'm not afraid of fire! At all!
Is there no way to make me happy?
Huh... When today is over, will another meaningless day come? Named tomorrow...
We must eliminate creatures like orcs from the world!
Get lost! Everyone, just get lost!
What's this play...
Everything drives me crazy!
What is this sweet smell? Blood...?
Who will fill my hungry half?
I'll curse everyone!
Is student and fool the same thing?
Hmm... about my dad's image... it felt kind of massive...
Eek! It's an ogre!
Hardin
Oh, have you arrived? Wait a moment, I have some preparations to make.
Say your farewell with [Olim] and press [alt + 2].
Alright, it seems [Olim] is ready.
[Olim] will give you 5 more seconds for a farewell.
[Olim] can't wait any longer now.
[Olim] will send you to Cerenis now.
Great! Let the remaining people prepare to depart.
Hurry, the magic circle will disappear soon.
I'll head to the destination first.
As expected, [Olim] is here.
Your role is to protect me from danger. In the end, there won't be much for [Olim] to do, so [Olim] will get bored quickly.
During this time, please listen to my story.
Respond positively with [alt + 2] and negatively with [alt + 4]. Got it?
This is a dangerous place, so I hope you've set up protection to keep outsiders out.
If you understand, show some reaction!
We've set up a device that only you all can see, so please do well.
Now, shall we start in earnest?
Well, finish your work and come over here.
Does [Hadin] know what [Olim] thinks of me?
[Olim]... Have you already forgotten what you should do?
Are the ones below idiots? Why are they so slow!
If you understand, show some reaction!
"What... did I rush too much... I feel sorry..."
Quickly set up arrow traps and come this way. It should be simple for you.
Is the start going smoothly? I'll rely on you in the future.
What's this! They're orcs! Even the orcs we turned white before are here! [Olim], I'm counting on you!
Is [Olim] scared and frozen?!
The ones below are definitely fools! Slower than this tortoise!
When a woman is angry! It's better to show some kind of reaction!
"Huh... these fools! Just a little faster! Why are they testing my patience..."
Well done! I hope you hurry up. This one should be simpler; create a magic circle to cross over here!
Ah... it's still bearable, but I wish you'd hurry a bit more...
[Hadin] must have known that this is the orcs' lair!
[Olim!] Stop whimpering! You idiot!
Ugh! You selfish fools!
[Olim], you!!
"I guess it looks like I'm more selfish..."
Good! Now defeat the gatekeepers and come over here.
Ugh... my concentration is dropping... Huh... ugh...
Now the last one. Give me [Olim] energy!
[Olim!!!!!]
What is this!!!
Are you all beyond saving?!
Well... consider it as them accepting it...
"These idiots seem to be waiting until I get annoyed! Ugh!"
[Olim] is ready, so I'll send [Hadin] first.
[Olim], are you ignoring me?
Ugh... get lost!!!
Ugh... yeah, don't stand there, just get lost!
[Olim] has crossed over to this side too. The ceremony will start soon, so come here quickly.
All the doors will close soon, so hurry over to this side!
There isn't much time; we must prevent the evil energy from escaping to the surface!
Taking advantage of the unstable dimensional boundary, evil beings will gather!
Everyone, get ready!
They're approaching faster than expected! Be cautious!
Evil beings are gathering again! Prepare yourselves!
Everyone, stay alert! A massive darkness is approaching!
Baphomet.
Who has summoned me!!!
Hehe... [Hadin], is it you! Hahaha!
What's this! There are prey everywhere!?
[Cerenis], you've finally come!
Ah... no! Why is [Cerenis] like this? [Olim], what happened?
[Yahi]! Yes... was it a plot...
Yahi.
Well done, my soldiers. You've exceeded my expectations. Kukuku.
To knock out even [Cerenis], impressive! Kukuku.
I'm sure you have many questions, but that magician won't give you time! Kukuku.
This... this is! Quickly run away! We're sealing this place!
Has it already begun?
[Cerenis], you've finally come!
[Cerenis], what are you doing? Stop!
Ugh... my body... doesn't obey...
[Cerenis!!!]
We must isolate [Cerenis]!
Balrog.
Is this your handiwork?
Yes, this is also His will...
I'm sure you're curious, but that magician seems to be in a hurry for the restroom. Huhuhu.
Stop breathing and escape quickly! Before your lungs melt in that heat. Hurry!
What is this!
It's dangerous! Run away quickly!
[Cerenis] is uncontrollable now! Everyone, escape!
Did I overestimate you all too much...
Everyone, escape! You'll only lose your lives if you stay longer!
This is a failure! Everyone, escape! We're sealing this place!
Gah! The magic circle is disappearing!
Everyone, escape! We're sealing this place!
[Olim!], where did you go at this crucial moment!
Everyone, run away! We're sealing this place!
'Not yet...' [Cerenis], hold on a little longer!
[Hadin]... that goat-like creature, it's too strong!
It seems it has already started!
It's impossible without [Cerenis]! Everyone, escape!
Is [Cerenis] still there! [Olim], what happened!
Stop breathing and escape quickly! Before your lungs melt in that heat. Hurry!
Those creatures are also acting according to the plan. Huhuhu...
Yes, everything is within His plan...
[Cerenis], are you still there.
Kukuku... [Hadin], see you next time!
[Baphomet], disappear now.
[Cerenis], you've finally come; divert the attention of that monster!
Why did it start so quickly!
Who summoned me? Kukuku!
What's this place! Is it a butcher shop?
[Cerenis], you've finally come!
Ah... no! Why is [Cerenis] like this? What happened, [Olim]?
[Baphomet], return to your master.
Shut up, you bonehead! Kaka! [Hadin], let's meet again! Kaka!
It's astonishing, [Cerenis] knocked out...
Hurry, run away!!! Quickly!
I'm sure you have many questions, but it seems that magician doesn't intend to give you any time. Huhuhu...
The plan went wrong! Run away quickly!
[Cerenis]! Buy us some time while we seal this place!

Hehehe~ When the land of dragons opens, I'll go hunting as the noble Hatchling!
Yeah, let's go separately and try hunting! I have no intention of having my treasure stolen!
This courageous Manku will go alone and knock them all down! Fuhehe~!
I heard there are a lot of hairy dwarf ladies over there~ What if they fall in love with my charm?
Hmph... I remember last time when you all went separately and couldn't catch a single one, and I had to... resurrect you...
You can only survive together, and there's a lot to gain, so don't think of going alone!
If we continue like this, the mission will fail! Step up your game!
When is [Cerenis] coming?
[Orim!] What happened?
Is [Cerenis] safe?
[Orim!] It's time to cook you!
What's going on here? Who's touching my prey?
[Orim!] What happened?
First, I'll cook you!
You presumptuous woman!
Sorry for being late.
[Cerenis], attract the attention of that monster!
I understand! But you do realize it's not an easy task, right?
[Hadin!] When I release my power, I don't know what will happen next!
You can leave the rest to me without [Cerenis].
Is it difficult without [Cerenis]?
Everyone! We don't have much time! Stay strong!
Well done, everyone.
This is... the scent of sweet blood...
[Cerenis]! Snap out of it!
This sound... it's the sound of fate... the wheels of destiny turning...
Knock [Cerenis] out!
Hmph... an irresponsible old man... he told me to take care of things... and in the end... it's come to this...
[Cerenis] has fallen!
Everyone! This is a last-minute decision to minimize damage!
What's this phenomenon?
Is this place collapsing? We've just succeeded!!!
Everyone, evacuate! I'll seal this place!
I'll soon block the southern exit, so hurry and escape!
If you go east, you'll see an escape route!
If you're still alive, you can aim for the next one! Hurry and escape!

That witch... I... can't... speak...
I... I... I... I'm scared of the witch...
[Valsim] I'm... sorry...
The witch... is... scary...
B... But... wh... when are we leaving?
I'm scared... I... I... can't wait...
We hit the witch.
I'm sorry...
I'm not feeling well.
I contacted them. They'll be here soon.
Captain, were we scared too?
I'm sorry again...
Don't go out alone!
Let's punish the witch!
[Balsim] You fools! Wait here!
Have you contacted our friends?
We'll wait here until our friends arrive!
It's noisy! I, the clever one, have devised a strategy!

The seal has been partially released [1/4].
About half of the seal has been released [2/4].
More than half of the seal has been released [3/4].
The seal has been completely released [4/4].
Shall we begin the final inspection?
If you don't need the final inspection, press [alt+2].
When you enter the dungeon, you'll be tested for your minimum qualifications.
They shouldn't be challenging opponents, so I believe you'll pass easily.
Also, there are platforms prepared for you to disarm or set traps.
I've made the platforms as easy to understand as possible, but...
I'll leave tackling my sense of aesthetics to others.
Besides that, there may be something to look forward to, but please hurry without being late.
Be careful! I can't guarantee your safety.
So, shall we begin?
Hadin: Phew... we barely managed to stop them. Keep your spirits up!
The fourth seal has been released [4/12].
Who woke me up... I'm... tired...
The eighth seal has been released [8/12].
Did the door open?
The first seal has been released [1/12].
The second seal has been released [2/12].
The third seal has been released [3/12].
The fifth seal has been released [5/12].
The sixth seal has been released [6/12].
The seventh seal has been released [7/12].
The ninth seal has been released [9/12].
The tenth seal has been released [10/12].
The eleventh seal has been released [11/12].
The final seal has been released [12/12].
The central platform can only be activated once, so be careful.
The central platform has been activated, and rewards have been determined.
Whispers flow into Orim's ear.

Hardin's Diary Exchange^Magic Letters
Orim: Everyone, don't be alarmed and listen to me.
Orim: If you don't need an explanation of the situation, you can skip with [alt+1].
Orim: What's attacking our ship is called an Aldin.
Orim: I'll provide more details once we survive this.
Orim: First, let me explain how to use the cannons.
Orim: When a red circle appears on the floor shortly, please step inside it.
Orim: I'll stand on a pad with the same pattern between the cannons.
Orim: Then, when I press [alt+4], the cannon will fire.
Orim: However, we also need to defend because the enemies will attack.
Orim: To defend, please step inside the yellow circle.
Orim: I'll cast a defensive spell with [alt+2] from my position.
Orim: Now, we need to prepare for the enemy's attack. Hurry.
Orim: There are shark schools nearby. Be careful.
Orim: I sense the habitat of sea harpies nearby. Be cautious!
Orim: It's a sea drake! Don't approach them; they seem dangerous!
Orim: What are those grotesque things! They look dangerous!
Orim: We don't have much time. Hurry.
Orim: Time is running out, so let's move on.
Orim: With this group, there's no way to proceed. Everyone evacuate.
Orim: I sense something lurking in the vicinity. Be cautious.
Orim: Ugh! Even sea creatures are attacking us now! Of all times!
Orim: Enemy ships are approaching! Get ready!
Orim: The ships will collide soon! Be careful not to fall into the sea!
Orim: Captain Drake's ship! Be cautious; they're strong!
Orim: It's a ghost ship! They won't give us a moment's rest!
Orim: Be careful! The incoming ships have a stronger aura than usual.
Orim: When the ships collide, enemies will board! Be careful!
Orim: Ugh..! I sense Olldey's aura coming from the approaching ship!
Orim: Enemies are boarding! Prepare yourselves!
Orim: Ugh!! Sea creatures with sharpened instincts are approaching!
Orim: It's a portal leading to the enemy's ship! Be careful; there's a strong presence inside.
??? : Lazy bunch! Get out and fight! Wipe them all out!
Orim: Enemies have boarded and are causing damage to our ship! Hurry!
Orim: The ship is sinking! Hurry and escape! This situation is hopeless!
First division has boarded.
Second division has boarded.
Third division has boarded.
Fourth division has boarded.
Aldin
Orim... Why did you let go of my hand... Why did you leave me alone...
Orim... Come with me... You can't leave me...
Orim! Now, I hate you! You're abandoning me!
Orim, you traitor! Did you think you could escape on your own!
His will is fulfilled through you...
Let's go... I will repay the prank you played on me...
Orim... Orim...
Orim. You're bothering me. Bad students must be punished, right?
Surprised? He released me again! Kukhahaha! It's time for revenge!
Sea Harpy
Sea Drake
Orim: We probably don't need a lot of explanations...
Orim: By now, the island I'm talking about has probably been reduced to ruins by them.
Orim: When you go back, many of the places you remember will have left no traces.
Orim: The fight has begun. I will find a way to end this fight by finding my master.
Orim: Please, all of you, survive until the end of this battle...
Orim: We're almost at Gludio Territory! We need to inform the people of this danger quickly!
Orim: We've defeated most of them. Please, hang on a little longer!
Aldin: You've handled it with just this many people... I will take charge of this ship.
Orim: The ship is about to sink. We must somehow protect the ship!
Orim: I sense a stronger energy than before! Be careful!
Orim: I sense a weaker energy than before. But still, be cautious!

You all! Meeting a burden even in a dream! Allahu, with glory!
In the world you are dreaming of me, do you have peace?
Everyone claims to be their own justice! Then, what will be the final justice!
Gadria! Appear before me! Do not make me wait any longer!
Gadria! Who told you to ride on a precious body! Foolish!
Gadria! I will now return to the arms of the family you are waiting for!

You fools! I will melt all of you!

Is this all you've got?
This won't be enough.
Greed... daring to enslave you! Die!
You... will... die...
You... shall... become my servants...
To... death... for all living beings...
I offer this sacrifice to the Grim Reaper.
Offer your heart, and I may forgive you. Muahaha!
I shall make you feel a special kind of terror!
Let me show you my power.
O Earth spirits, assist me.
Do you think you can escape from me?
Kneel before me!
Sisters, come to me!
Cruel winds! Freeze them all!
Do you think you can defeat me like this?
Bravery is but an illusion!
Show the true power of a knight! Endure it!
You insolent creatures.
Feel the power of death.
Disappear.
Dare you challenge the one who obtains immortality?!
Dare you challenge a god?!
Feel the difference in power!
Scream, O souls!
Enough is enough! I decree death upon you!

You masquerade as a believer. What are you up to? Can't you hurry up and get married?
No, it's not my fault. Where has the high priest gone at a time like this?
Aaahhh! Please help me!
Once you learn the power of magic, there's no turning back...
Don't you realize that the energy of the world revolves around me!
A little more time. If I had just a little more time...
Ah... so this is how it ends...
Thank you so much for attending my wedding.
Shh! Be quiet. She might come...
I just did what I was told...ta...ta...help me ......
Can you guys understand my pain so far?
I've come to know the power of new spells...
He was able to harness the power of witchcraft to keep people close to him...
When the year of the Black Dragon arrived and I spoke a little about the engery of Halpas, people did not doubt, but on the contrary began to believe...
The religion of Harpathism has been a good tool...ughahahahaha.
You want me to give up such wonderful power!
Never, never give up!
Bayliss was just about to let the world know about this...that's why I kidnapped him...
Summons of the Faithful
I dressed as a man and pretended to be an aide in order to watch the investigative process.
How do you feel about not noticing me beside you?
I will only acknowledge the ability of the undercover team to get this far.
This is it! There is no one who can stop me!

Are you the ones who shouted the hero's call? 
Do you think you're heroes?
I will never fall!
Is merely holding the hero's call enough?
There is no mercy of magic for you!
Swirl in the chaos and be swept away!
Do you think shouting the hero's call alone makes you a hero?
Put shackles on your hands!
Your hands will twist, and your body will tear apart!
Death to those who shouted the hero's call!
Slaves, meet your end!
You are slaves who cannot control yourselves!

Sandworms!!! How dare they... destroy our sanctuary... I will never forgive them!
Hey, human! Have you ever seen a sandworm?
Is there any point in asking a human?
Of course, there's no point! Weak humans would have met their demise the moment they saw a sandworm!
Right now, humans are not the issue. Ignore the humans and find the sandworms!

How dare you come here?!
Ugh... You're strong...
I'll erase you with magic!
Damn it...
Hehehe... You're quite good!
Don't underestimate me!
I won't just stand by...
Is it going to end like this?
I won't send you to Lord Barranca!
Ah...
Hehehe... Become food for the beasts!
Grr...
Quietly erase them.
It can't be like this...
You like my black blood!
This is absurd!
Witness the power of the King of Assassins!
Mr. Dantes... bring salvation...
Bring death!
Ugh....
Let's fight! Come at me!
Formidable opponents...
Hahaha...
Oh, Dantes...
How dare you come here?
Dantes...
This is a sacred place! Leave immediately!
We just need a bit more time...
Dantes's resurrection! I'll make it happen!
Glory to Lastabad...
Someone like you!
Dantes... give me strength...
Get out now!
It's unfair! It's frustrating!
Just a little more... more!! Don't interfere!
Just a bit... a bit more!!
Become Dantes's offering!
At Dantes's side...
Guardian Soldiers
Burn in the black flames of another world!
Kuh! Master Girtas!

After a moment, the performance will begin. The venue manager is distributing cheer items, so please put them on once you receive them.
The performance will start in 60 seconds.
Ladies and gentlemen, world star Psy has arrived. Please welcome him with applause.
Hello, everyone. I'm singer Psy.
You are the champions who truly know how to enjoy! Everyone, make some noise!
I've completely transformed~ Hey, kids, jump~!
What's my style~? Gangnam style~! Everyone, make some noise!
Hehe, wait a moment, oppa~
Psy oppa, this is a gift for you~ If you wear these shoes and perform, it'll be even more exciting~!
Wow, a fan from the girl group! Thank you for the gift~
Huh, why are these shoes acting up? They're moving on their own~
Humans... They can't appreciate things if they're free~
My friends should be arriving soon. I'm leaving now~
Everyone, please help me. My feet are tied up, and I can't move~
Ant Queen has spawned..
Sandworm has spawned..
Red Knight's Adance
What are these unexpected fellows!
How audacious, they're underestimating my fans!
Everyone, hold on a little longer! We need to drive them away quickly and start the performance!
Oh, is it going to end like this without even starting the performance...
My legs are gradually becoming paralyzed, it's impossible to hold on any longer...
Who are they? The ones tormenting our Psy oppa!
Oppa! Stay strong~ We'll go help you in no time!
Our stamina is dwindling~ This is a big problem!
Everyone, please help me!
I need your strength to save Psy oppa!
Is this Psy's performance venue? It seems like we've found the right place.
Even these small fry haven't been dealt with yet? Did I choose opponents too easily?
It looks like I won't need to exert much force. This should be an easy fight.
Prepare yourselves; the difference in dimension between you and those who have been babbling so far is quite significant.
If there are fewer than 10 participants, the performance will be canceled.
Thank you very much~ If it weren't for all of you, we would have been in big trouble. As a token of our gratitude, we've prepared a small gift, so please accept it.
We've defeated all the bad guys. Please wait a moment for the victory medals to be distributed.
Since the performance venue is in disarray, we will tidy up the area before resuming the performance.
Thank you for your hard work. Please return safely.
Psy has fallen. Please wait a moment for the Trial Medals to be distributed.
As Psy recovers, we will continue with the performance.
We need some rest, so please leave.
Defense successful.
The barrier blocking the path has been removed. Please move to either side of the path.
The monster attack will begin shortly. Please put on your cheer items and get ready for battle.
Hey! Where are you going? You stay right there!

This performance has been canceled due to insufficient participants.
We'll see you in the next performance. Please return safely.
The mission has failed due to exceeding the time limit. Please wait a moment for the Trial Medals to be distributed.
It seems difficult to defeat all the incoming enemies.
I'll take Psy and retreat first, so please evacuate quickly.
The battle will last for 15 minutes, and if the time limit is exceeded or we fail to protect Psy, the mission will fail.
There are 10 minutes left until the end of the battle.

Why have the likes of you humans joined hands with the Orlim?
You humans are bothering me.
Is it rebellion against one who possesses great magical power like me?
No matter how close you are to them, you cannot stop me.

Baphomet's Minion
To lift Baphomet's curse...
For the possessor of great magical power...
I cannot reveal my true identity to the likes of you.
Is this all that you could muster to find me?
How dare a mere disciple of Gunter defy me!
I shall let you feel the power of madness!
I shall show you hell!
A Necromancer has appeared.

The Aden Kingdom will be dominated entirely by our Black Knights.
The Red Knights cannot be considered as enemies of Lord Ken Rauhel.
The Red Knights will disappear without a trace by tomorrow. Hahaha!
All you ignorant puppies who don't know the terror of Lord Ken Rauhel, disappear!
If you want to die, come at us anytime. Show the power of Lord Ken Rauhel and the Black Knights!

KkomaeTi's Ice-Cold Cube Box
Have you heard of the magazine BUFF?
I heard that this guy named Itis has set out to find the famous Enchant Guild.
I don't know what kind of hidden treasure he's looking for, but there's something mysterious in the air! Sniff, sniff~

Explosion
Come out, my sacrifices!
Death Knight
Is... this... the end...
It's time to break free from this illusion...
Damn... you gave me a mortal wound...
If it were just a little deeper...
Kukuku...while you sleep, you will be my slave and wander...hahahahaha!
How can a human being have this much power...?
Gghh...this curse...is this your last desperate attempt?
Kukuku... my curse will haunt you until the moment your desire is gone... hahahahaha!
The sword was cursed by the blood of Valakas, but it should retain some of its original power...
We're going to use the power of that sword to get out of here.
Maybe it's the curse, but when I use the sword, my past battles with Valakas and myself rarely come to the surface...
Maybe you can watch the fight too. Now go...I can't take much more of this.
The spirit of the Death Knight flows in. (Time remaining: 30 minutes)
You feel the will of the Death Knight. (Time remaining: 20 minutes)
The sword burns up violently. (Time Left: 10min)
The power of the sword begins to be suppressed. (Time Left: 5min)
You feel that there is not much time left. (Time Left: 3min)
You start to lose consciousness. (Time Left: 1min)
Master Valakas will show no mercy to you.
Under the curse of Master Valakas, you will continue to wander this world until you die.

Unengraved Package
Destroy... everything... everything...
Who are you?
I...I...I am...a knight...yes, I was a knight... Why are you here?
Knight?
That's right...I'm a knight...a foolish knight who overestimated his power and challenged Valakas...
Were you defeated by Valakas?
Defeated...yes...I am defeated. My memory and consciousness... are slowly fading...
Take this sword and get out of here before I completely lose my reason.
Valakas: Who woke me up?
Death Knight: Valakas! You finally showed up...
Valakas: The price for disturbing my sleep... be my slave and pay it till death...
Death Knight: Hmmm, I'll let you say those words after you defeat me.
Valakas: Kukuku... you have a lot of confidence...
Valakas: Die! Human!
If you never leave...
You cheeky little... follow me!
Let's use even more force to subdue them!
Face the greater forces of fire in the cave!

We've always been famous
This year will be the same, but next year will be different.
I missed a lot of games this year due to injuries.
Next year, we will steadily build up the number of wins.
We will always lead as rivals~
I won't be able to see you this fall, but I'll definitely rise to the top next year!!
Although it is said that we are not at the 2014 autumn party~
Next year we will definitely participate!
I don't know how long it will be without us in the fall.
Next year, I will definitely show you the face of an autumn emperor!!
But at the end of the day, I showed you what
You can't stop the reckless march of the dinosaurs...
Ugh!~ As the rumors say, it's a powerful dinosaur!
As much as you beat me and climbed up, I want you to rise to the top spot.
Oh no.. how??
A 2-year-old dinosaur has this kind of power...

Orim: First of all, please calm down. We must protect the ship.
Orim: The person attacking our ship is named Aldin.
Orim: We'll talk more about that later!
Orim: It would take at least three people to deal with Aldin. Oh, and if the boat leaves the shore, the enemy will attack. Watch out!
Orim: The enemy are breaking in! Prepare for attack!
Orim: I sense a strange spirit... be careful!
Orim: The enemy are gathering. Watch out!
Orim: The enemy are gathering. Hang in there a little longer!
Orim: Aldin is getting closer! Please be careful!
Orim: I don't need to explain this or that any longer...
Orim: By now, the Talking Island will have been reduced to ruins by their hands.
Orim: When we returned, all our memories would have vanished without a trace...
Orim: The battle has just begun. I will meet with my master and try to find a way to end this fight.
Orim: Until the day this battle is over...
Orim: We must tell everyone about this crisis!
Orim: There is nothing we can do with this force. Run away!
Orim: This is not going to be enough to fight Aldin.
Orim: Get people together and come back!
Orim: I'll wait here...
Aldin: That's it... This ship belongs to me.
Orim: The enemy has retreated. It looks like we can take a little break.
Enemy ship damaged and retreated.
Orim: I feel Aldin's spirit!

Items purchased in the Theberus area will be removed when you return to your original world.

Experience and items will not be lost if a player dies in the Theberus siege.
When the game restarts or ends, the game returns to the original world.
Winning the Theberus siege will provide 30 minutes of additional hunting time to progress in the defeat of the ancient gods.
Collecting 5,000 or more Dimensional Fragments will earn you a victory/defeat reward.
Successful PK'ing of players from other worlds earns a portion of the Dimensional Fragments for the deceased player.
Every three minutes after the Osiris domination stone is destroyed, one domination stone of the world that has gathered the most members in the central region inside the pyramid is activated.
The first world to activate 3 domination stones in each world wins.
Worlds that lose the siege of Theberus will be forced to teleport to their original world.
Press the "&" key for general chat and the "^" key for world-specific chat.
If the number of active domination stones at the end of the Theberus siege is the same, the world with the higher points wins.
You can also move inside the pyramid by going through the pyramid basement.
Inside the pyramid, the curse of Osiris has been placed on the pyramid, causing a significant reduction in HP.
World Point and dominant stone activation information is available in the Theberus UI.
The Osiris curse can be lifted by collecting world points.

Battle Trader^Theon
The match starts 60 seconds after entry. You can start quickly if all players press the "Prepare" button at the bottom right. 
You can purchase items needed for battle from Theon.
If you purchase class package items, you can quickly set consumables. Items you don't need can be purchased from the Battle Merchant.
You can enter the Colosseum with only equipment items and Magic Dolls, except invisibility cloaks.
If you do not win within the time limit, the win/loss will be divided according to the number of deaths and attack points, and the draw will be handled when everything is the same.
Only 2 Colosseum coins will be paid at the start of the game, and various consumables can be purchased from NPC Theon.
During the match, an exlusive Colosseum shortcut slot is added, so you can use Coloseeum exclusive items in those slots.
At the end of the season, your stats may be reset.
Cheering messages can be seen by both players and spectators.

Get off me right now!
The whole world shall be smouldered by death!
Nothing excites me more than red blood, chuckling..
Moron.. who dares steps in front of me!
I'll share the pain I've suffered with you too.
You're challenging me.. Let me make you feel that foolishness!
Don't think this is the end!
I will watch your deaths with my own eyes..!
This is how you're going to get die..
Don't promise next time! ha ha ha
Wait for you at the threshold of death!
My body may fall, but I will wake up again!

You're next.
The king's desires should never be satisfied....
Defend the Temple of the Reaper!
There are signs of humans....
Believe me! ...You don't believe me?
Become a dead man and follow me...
Come on, come on, come on...!

Knock, knock... Knock, knock, knock...
I can feel the human breath...
I feel the cold air of human....
Feel the warmth of human....

Valakas: Krrr... Annoying pests have arrived.
Valakas: Are you also Handpas' subordinates...?
Valakas: It doesn't matter. If you're pests, I'll just wipe you out.
Valakas: You dared to defile this sacred place; you'll regret it!
Valakas: Persistent creatures like insects! I'll treat you all like the same vermin!
Death Knight: Grgrrgrr... Valakas...!!
Orim: Stay calm! Don't forget to use the power of the Death Knight!
Valakas: You will pay the price for making me angry...!!
Valakas: Krrr... Insignificant beings crawling around...
Valakas: I will step back today... But the day will come when the vile shackles are released and my strength is restored...
Valakas: That day will be your last...
Orim: Aah... Half success... Even with the power of the Death Knight, we couldn't defeat him completely...
Orim: But you all did well! Valakas will remain silent for a while...
Orim: ...Oh no, this is bad! The balance of power that has ruled this place is collapsing!
Orim: Hurry, everyone! Return to a safe place quickly...!
Orim: Be careful, everyone... He has already awakened from his slumber!
Orim: The surrounding flames... it seems he's set a trap to confine you, so be cautious.

This is the house I've been staying in for 14 years.
I feel like someone broke into my house.
Creepy. I think someone came in.
I'll be a wonderful ghost one day, too.

Glory to the shadow of the flame...
We shall rise again with the power of Master Yahi!
Gruul... I have not yet...
I don't fear death...
My anger will never subside!
Still... not strong enough...
You know nothing...
I never thought I would suffer such humiliation...
Grrr.. everything will be as I want it to be!
So much for...?
Someday I will show you... what I see!
I can finally rest in peace...................................
Helvain will judge you all!
I will follow in his footsteps...
I'm sorry...Lia
Was this the extent of my ability?
Even if I fall my will will not yield.
Ba...I believe in Master Barranca...
When Master Slave arrives your fate will be sealed.
good...the enemy...

Visit all for Master Dantes!
It's about time I showed you what I can do!
Master Balod made the right choice!
Do you know what suffering in hell is?
Now go away...
Let's put you through this pain too...
The greater the pain, the greater the joy...
Let's bring all to their death!
You think you can stop me!?
It is the bright red blood that brings me to the peak of excitement...hohoho
Inflict on me even deeper pain!
I envy you guys who can feel pain...
Try harder... harder to contort your face...
The stench of decay wafts from your souls as well...
The more depraved a soul is, the more it cannot escape the sweet smell of the devil.
Selfishness divides you! Kuh-ha-ha!
What do you think? How do you feel the power you're experiencing for the first time?
It is better to give up hope in vain.
Your prophecies are but a mirage.
Ufff... don't leave anything behind.
Let me show you the power of darkness.
I will watch you die with my own eyes!
Ugh...I remember that one...ugh...
My faith is not misplaced.
My frozen heart...

Grrr~! Someday I will tear humans to pieces.
Guaaaahhh...
Damn, that sucks...
Let Master Peacock tear you to pieces.
Gooooo...
You...
See you again on a bright moonlit night, heh.
Goh... goh...
Guaaaahhh...
Finally, they're going to let us go...
My grudge is not over yet...
Blood calls for blood...
We've got to get him!
Ummm...
Damn...
It died once. I won't die again...
Kookkook. Baphomet will bury you all.
Tsk!

Gghhhh...
Don't let any of them leave alive...
Stop him...
I didn't know there was such a powerful thing...
I will report this to the captain..
Cold floor...
Do not inform them of my death...
Please do not...
We can't just give in like this.
Mr. Kurtz I am sorry...
My weapons are made of silver, so they're good for hunting!
Shhhh!
Oh my gosh!
When Mr. Kurtz arrives, everything will be resolved.
They're the little ones, huh?
Come on, ordinary people!
All those muscles. Cool, right?
Smell a Red Knight somewhere around here...
I'd like to finish it quickly and get out of here.
Oh my gosh!
Help me!

Welcome, my dear, I see you've received my wedding present.
Let's give them a big firework display worthy of a gorgeous ceremony!
I hope you die!
I did receive your gift, Unura!
I don't feel anything. It's over!
Are you trying to interfere with my ceremony?
You humble people... I am the Queen!
Come out and greet your guests, servants!
Uhhh... my wedding... King...please take care of me...
Kiah... my wedding... It's Evoltine...
Grrrrr... intruder found... eliminate.
Guru Ruru... Guru... Less... Mabu!
Gurururu... Kill... Guru... Aima...!
Guru... Leslene... Legdov...!
Gurururu... I can't escape...
Grrrr... if you resist, I will kill you... all of you!
Guru... offerings... will not be missed...
Guru... summon the watcher...
Guru... intruder... failed to eliminate...
If only... if only... if only... if only Bard's... if only he had an eye left over...
The noise is probably due to the uninvited guests...
You better not irritate me. Unless you want to be preyed upon!
You brought this on yourselves... burn it down!
I will drink all your blood!
You're so bloody arrogant!
I haven't had enough yet, take more!
Don't resist in vain. Quietly offer your blood and soul!
Show yourselves, my minions!
Not enough blood... my blood... kuuuuuuh.
Coo... my throat is burning... if only I could get rid of this dryness!
All who live in this land... shall be exterminated!
Take it... all die!
I will kill the living... and bury them!
A fresh body...I'll curse you...Rotten!
Kill... Tear... Decorate... Happy...
With such a powerless body you cannot defeat me...
Flesh...must be maintained.... The body... the corpse... the dead flesh...
Blood makes me...excited! !
Ugh... my body... will be destroyed... by those stupid guys...
Ugh...Curse the living...I can't control my anger...If only I had Bardo's right arm...
Gurururu... The fearless ones have stepped into my territory...
Taste my wrath with your body!
Gwah! Don't think you can escape!
I'll tear you to pieces!
The little bastards are getting cocky!
This is my territory... I'll never let you through!
Grun...I can't take it anymore...I'm going to choke the life out of you right now!
Guru... guru...
Gurururu...I won't admit it...I'm sure this wound will heal!
Gurururu...it's a good idea to run away...before this wound heals!
Do the perishables dare to challenge me, the Eternal?
Your death is imminent.
This is ancient power!
The power of the desert, I wonder if I can withstand it...
Cheeky...I am the ancient king!
It works... how would you like to be my servant?
Reaper, release my sealed power!
Behold this overflowing power!
It's a shame... if only I could regain my true strength, I would trample you all!
Reaper! If only I had my strength back I wouldn't be in such humiliation...
Hohoho, looks like a good toy has arrived.
Come on, give me a present!
Be quiet...it's hard to play with you.
Hohohoho...would you like to try this?
I think I've been bitten by a mosquito...I'll make it prettier for you.
Hahahaha, this is fun...you'll enjoy it!
Let's see, you'll have to entertain me some more!
Better to play with everyone than alone, right? Ohohoho.
Ha... empty... but it was fun. Bye...
Aaah... too bad... would have loved to play with you more...
...the time has come...
The door of death opens...
The ancient power has been divided...
Now you're ready for the sacrifice...

You're here...which...let's see what you can do.
I'll set the example, take it!
Fearless, this is how a battle is fought!
I can't watch this, let's get this over with here!
Are you kidding me? You better come at me straight!
Nonsense. I can't believe you thought you could beat me at this level.
Sweet. You're wasting my time!
My power is limitless!
Kk, it doesn't look too bad.... I wish you good luck to the end.
As good as this one is, it seems worth a bet....please.
A barbaric act... to challenge the greatest emperor in the land...
Die, for this is the power of the great king!
You cannot hurt me!
Taste the power of destruction and ruin!
I'm so sick to my stomach. You are the most soft-hearted people I've ever met.
It's Ok. Struggle some more!
You have the nerve to stand against an immortal being!
Dark magic, forever!
I shall not die... as long as there is a tower... I am eternal!
I will not allow it... for I am the eternal and immortal King!
Did you come here to be an offering?
You arrogant overconfidence in your own power, may you be punished!
You immature people who don't know your place, you will be punished!
You irreverent ones who try to challenge God on your own, may you suffer damnation!
That's about it... have you run out of steam?
I will only praise your courage. Otherwise, it wouldn't even have value as an offering.
Not bad for an insignificant lowly creature.
Let's take the thunder of wrath!
Whenever and whoever you are... we are watching you...
We'll see how long that arrogance lasts...
Violent Reaper Soul: You are a tough soul to have come this far.
Give me your soul... and I will put it to good use.
I like the most music.
I send you painless... offerings...
You want to meet the real Grim Reaper!
That will not be enough to open the door. Put all your energy into it.
It is approaching...the glorious moment when Unura will become an offering.
Guo... guaah!
O you who live...die.
Violent Reaper Soul: This completes the tyrannical force.
Wicked Reaper Soul: Kukuku...it will be a good offering.
Let us dedicate every last drop of our souls to it.
This will be your graveyard.
Struggle to your death.
You're going to meet the Grim Reaper anyway. It would be better to meet him in death.
That won't open the door. Pour more soul into it.
Keep it up. Wield your strength... kukuk...
Kuh... uu... kuh...
Death... approaches...
Wicked Reaper Soul: Finally, the time has come for the completion of the wicked power...kuhuhuhuhu.
Those who are to be the offerings of the tower have stepped into it themselves.
Arrogant ones, I will retrieve your souls!
Taste the infinite power of an immortal being!
This is the last time. Be a offering to the tower!
You are a dishonest person who is supposed to be an offering!
Kukk... you still can't give up, hoping that you can win!
You little children, no matter how hard you try, the result will be the same!
Bury yourselves here, you arrogant ones!
Consider yourself lucky this time... unless you can let go of your arrogance, that day will come again...
Wait and see... when you die, you will meet me again anyway... and I will take your soul then.
Talking Island is ours!

Did you call me? Woof! Woof!
Meow! You have to be more adorable, Nyan.
Yay for enhanced wildness!
Kunkun-kun! I smell orc!
Woof! You're gonna be scared when you grow up!
You don't have to feed your pets anymore~!
Let's get wild animals from "Rodney".
Previously Internet Caf:  Pets can be obtained as rewards in the Monster Codex.
type '/petaction' you'll get a nice emote!
Pet commands can be registered in quick slots.
You can earn "friendship points" by hunting with your pet.
You can strengthen your pet's wildness with the "Friendship Point."
Oblivious pets can be traded, but lose their wildness.
The more the fighting spirit builds up, the higher the attack power, resulting in a fighting spirit combo.

I want to paint everything in you.
You're a criminal, a criminal who made me melt.
This one, you have to hide it and eat it alone! Okay?

I'm good enough to see what you eat. You eat a lot alone.

A group of cursed people rushes in.
Get ready for the next attack.
The curse is getting stronger.
The final dark band is closing in.
Block all attacks.
Whoa! A monster!
Protect the crystal ball in the center.
If the time runs out or the crystal ball is destroyed, you fail.
Orim will lend you a little help.
Cursed fog causes severe pollution damage.
A cursed spirit is approaching.
Go to the teleportation magic circle generated in front of Orim.
Now you are back in your world.
The party has been destroyed.
The space-time travel ends.
Please try again next time.
Ah... the crystal ball has been destroyed...
The space-time travel ends.
Please try again next time.
You succeeded in helping Orim.
Soon the space-time travel will come to an end.
May the blessings of Einhasad be upon your future...
Orim's tears... calm the wall of fire...
On the other side of the wall are the wretched priests who summon curses.
"Sema"...I'm sorry...
The summoning of flame monsters has stopped.
Merkyor...just wait a little longer...
The summoning of monsters in the deep sea has stopped.
Baltuzar will put you out of your misery...
The summoning of the wind-wave monster has stopped.
Caspa...you should know the truth...
The summoning of earth monsters has stopped.

Master Rosas won't let you live!
Ughhhh...I'm coming back again.
You have offended me... and the One will not forgive you!
Go to the lighthouse at the far east end. From there you can reach the underground canal.
The end of the waterway is connected to Crocodile Island.
I won't stop you if you insist, but... be careful.
You want to go to a place that even we have stayed away from for decades.
This is the place where the crocodile king Rosas, who has become a monster, is sealed up.
May God bless you...
Soon the monsters will be pouring in.
Be prepared.
Ah...I've lost you too.
Go back to your world and have a good rest.
Thank you for your efforts. Thanks to you, there will be peace for a while.
Now, go back to your world.

I thought the odds of losing to you were less than 10%, but it seems I was wrong.
I've been waiting for you for two days. At last we meet.
You...! We have met on the third floor of the Insolence Tower!
It's frustrating to be killed by your sword that doesn't even have a 4th stage attribute enhancement! !
All you get for killing me is five teleportation scrolls.
I see you are happy to get your +6 sword. Sounds like you in the past...
You jumped on me just because I was wearing +7 Knights' armor. This is what it means to be a frog in a well.
Come on, all 8 of you together. You think you can beat me!
To try to defeat me with a +9 Knights Dagger....I am dumbfounded.
They say a +10 Sword is without mercy. But you don't deserve even that kind of mercy.
Go to 11th Street and strengthen your equipment before you go.
Get the hell out of here before midnight!
It was you who took the elixir from me 13 years ago!
14 years from now, you will still be here, unchanged.
15 billion spent will be wasted, and that's what we have here. Keep that in mind and listen up!
Do you think you can hold me back from mastering the hexadecimal system?
You have only a 17% chance of getting out of here in one piece.
18...
When I first met you, you were a 19 year old boy. You've grown up while I haven't seen you for a while, hahaha.
Don't turn away, look hard, you've endured 20 years for this moment!
Twenty-one years. I've waited 21 years to see you like this again.
22...I will give you 22 seconds of my time.
It's already 23:00. This is the end of my time playing with you.
You have not grown up after 24 hours.
Looking at your useless body, you're not even CON25.
You have a 26% chance of getting an audience with me.
Your ER doesn't seem to reach 27. Not even one of my arrows can be dodged.
There are already more than 280,000 people who gave their lives to me...
You're the 290,000th person to give me your soul!
Remember when level 30 was the chat level!
Listen carefully. 31 seconds later you will regret not running away.
Go quickly. To challenge me with a sword that does less than 32 damage...
As long as the 33 spirits follow me, this place will not collapse.
Nothing like the miracle on 34th Street...
What have you been up to since you stole 35 elixirs from me?
Hahaha. Thirty-six measures are better than running away. This is your last chance!
Close your eyes. Do you see it? This is what will happen to you in the future, 37 years from now.
The odds of you beating me are one in 380,000.
If I were to buy your soul, the estimate would be roughly...39 adena?
How can you be 40 years old and in your infirm years and still be lost? It's laughable.
You were a young man in your youth, and now you are already 41 years old... The passage of time is truly merciless.
Everyone gets along well and in 42 seconds you'll be in the afterlife!
The password is 43... Now it's time to get stronger!
Tsk tsk....you think you can challenge me with a hit that's not even 44!
Ugh... to be beaten by a mere 45 damage...

The Ant Queen's hiding place has been discovered! Come, we'll take you to the entrance!
It's a catastrophe... the confusion continues that we can't recognize each other.
Will trust be maintained in the midst of chaos? Now the ugly mind of man will be revealed.
Ant Queen's will is activated. Be prepared for a change of vigilance.
Ant Queen's will was pierced. His vigilance changed.
I'll make you feel the fear of death, you puny humans! !
Is this the extent of your strength!? !
Go ahead and cry your eyes out in misery.
Interesting! Really interesting! !
You can't run away from me. Let me have my fun!
Do not fear death!
Arrgggghh...I'm so frustrated...if my body hadn't been injured...
To those who oppose me! There is only death!
I'm gonna burn it all down! Uhhahaha!
Come, my creatures!
Let those wretches be afraid!

Aah! My body won't listen to me!
Haa...has the end finally come...
This is your last chance. If you want to run, now is the time.
Do you hear it? The sound of your soul being swallowed by a nightmare!
They would rather make you beg them to kill you.
Welcome to a nightmare you can't get out of.
Who is the scary thing that woke me up? You guys!
Pfft, I will be stuck in this nightmare forever!
Oh, my God! You have to endure this!
Ummm, now this is going to hurt just a little bit!
Don't avoid it.  It's an arrow that contains my heart.
Have you already fallend for me? That's weird.
Excellent. It has enough charm to catch my eye.
Haha. I feel like this...you're the first.

Looks like all those stupid keepers are gone...
I beat the keeper and he still surrounds me...
Seems like these light barrier don't go away easily...
You'll never get to me at this rate... move faster!
Free me from this troublesome barrier as soon as possible!
Almost... almost...
I hope that with my power... we can break this ward...!
Looks like we're almost there...
How I have longed for this moment...
My magic is more powerful now that I've been sealed up!
I will turn this coliseum into your graveyard...
I am the ruler of Aden World...
Not a vessel to be sealed in this coliseum!
Seems we don't have much time...
It seems the barrier of light wasn't completely broken...
Slowly... slowly... you're surrounding me again...

The chat window is shared by everyone. Please use respectful language.
Respectful and kind language is the beginning of a beautiful online culture.
A character's name is their face. Please use beautiful and sweet character names.
Anonymity is guaranteed in the online world, so you shouldn't harm others. A caring mind for others is the soil of a bright and healthy online culture.
Small community efforts lead to a better online experience for everyone.
Lineage official website address is www.lineage.co.kr. Please be aware of other websites and e-mails that pretend to be official websites.
The server you are using is a test server. The purpose of a test server is testing the contents to be updated on the live server.
The test server is only for testing, so please understand that unexpected problems may occur due to testing.
Please note that the test server purpose is testing, so it is not possible to restore characters or items due to special environments.
The test server is a server for testing, so please understand that the contents of the game, such as items and castle information related to sieges, can always be changed during the testing process.
The server rate for item drops, including adena, is increased 5x in the test server.
Items or character information on the test server may be deleted/modified/initialized without notice due to operational or planning needs. Thanks for your understanding.
In test server, Windawood Castle is primarily owned by the TestTeam Clan and managed by the TestTeam.
The server's official Game Masters are Metis, Cassiopeia, Misophia, Agatha, Cyrus, Erastos and Homeros characters. They will never ask for passwords/account information.
If someone claims to be a Game Master and asks for your username or password, feel free to contact us by email so we can take appropriate action.
Bug reports or other suggestions would be appreciated if you report them to "Lineage website customer center -> Direct e-mail -> Game Content Related -> Applicable server E-Mail".
We select people who have contributed a lot to development or operation by reporting bugs or other suggestions every month, and we offer benefits to them, so we ask for your active participation.
Accounts that exploit bugs and cause relative damage to the majority of good players who play normally are subject to game service restrictions.
Please pay special attention to password/account information management. In addition, we inform you that account hijacking is a criminal act and can be punished under the applicable law.
Once a character name is chosen, it cannot be changed.
Characters with an inappropriate name may be deleted without notice.
When using the exchange window, check the item list and the other party's character name once more before completing the transaction.
If you select several items together using the SHIFT key, please make sure you haven't mistakenly selected items you don't want.
If you select another item using the Shift key while unequipping a weapon or armor, if you try to discard or delete it, the weapon or armor may also be discarded or deleted.
Items that fall on the floor are considered not owned by anyone. Be sure to double check the item before putting it on the floor.
Cash transactions hinder the establishment of a healthy online culture and cause various problems both inside and outside the game.
The act of listing a phone number on the bulletin board is considered an act of cash transaction, so the character is subject to restrictions on game services.
In-game trades are exchanges between items within the server. Other cash transactions, account/character transactions, and item transactions between servers are not recognized as legitimate transactions and are subject to restrictions on game services.
Game services may be restricted if items/accounts are used for purposes other than games, account/character transactions, or item transactions between servers.
Characters may remain in Lineage World for a while due to line failure or other issues when the game ends. Therefore, please always quit in a safe place.
Arbitrary changes to the Lineage client or use of illegal programs are acts that cause damage to many users who play normally. Therefore, these actions are subject to restrictions on game services.
Lineage is a game made by your hands. Your manners and pride make the best online games in the world.
Excessive gaming immersion can harm your mental and physical health.
Item trading has become more convenient with the shop system and market zone update. Please note that you may be penalized if you use an illegal program or try to exchange in an unusual way that is not supported by the game.
Please set your Lineage password differently from the password you use on other sites. Also, it is recommended that you change your password periodically.
The world chat window is a space for various in-game/external stories, and the merchant chat window is a space for posting business-related articles. Please create a pleasant community environment by using appropriate chat windows.
If you have lost your password or quiz, or want to change it, you can set a new one yourself through the launcher and the webpage.
